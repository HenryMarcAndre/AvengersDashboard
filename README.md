Avengers Dashboard

Inspired by NHL player cards made by @JFreshHockey on twitter, I thought it would be cool to try an build my own player cards using python. Instead of using hockey players, I used Avengers. I used pandas to clean and organize the data, and streamlit to build the application. 

The Marvel data used for this project is from @dannielr on kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dannielr/marvel-superheroes).
